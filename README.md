## Behind the Rebuild

After completing the renowned <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Development Bootcamp</a> by Colt Steele and gaining hands-on experience as a SDE intern this past summer, I wanted to apply the new tech stack I had learned to one of my favorite projectsâ€”YelpCamp. This gave me a great opportunity to practice my web development skills. And so, YelpCamp React was born.

The most challenging parts for me were implementing authentication and authorization, managing image uploads, and designing efficient data structures. Some aspects required significant time debugging the data transmission between the front-end and back-end to ensure seamless functionality. Additionally, incorporating newly learned technologies also posed challenges, such as using the `useContext` hook for authentication state management, which I learned through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer">Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate</a> on Coursera, and implementing `react-toastify` to handle flash messages on the front end in response to user actions.

However, this journey of overcoming challenges was incredibly meaningful to me. I experimented with new technologies, implemented Git version control, and set up CI/CD pipelines to streamline the development and deployment process. The independent development process also gave me a deeper understanding of full-stack development. It enhanced my ability to tackle complex problems and strengthened my confidence in building robust and scalable web applications.
