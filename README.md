## Behind the Rebuild

After completing the renowned Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele and gaining hands-on experience as a SDE intern this past summer, I wanted to apply the new tech stack I had learned to one of my favorite projectsâ€”YelpCamp. This gave me a great opportunity to practice my web development skills. And so, YelpCamp React was born.
